Simple script that creates an S3 bucket.

Note: there are some prerequisites the user needs before running the script and some things to think about, such as:

- AWS CLI needs to be installed
	
- Sandpit account needs to be configured
	
- Note:  potential issues with mismatch of AWS profiles when running script from another users computer
	
- Note: issues with creating a duplicate S3 bucket
